# FreeRTOS_QUEUE
FreeRTOS | Queue | GPIO | RTC
This project is a robust application designed for the STM32F446RE microcontroller, leveraging FreeRTOS to manage user commands received over UART. It integrates efficient handling of LED controls and real-time clock (RTC) functionalities using FreeRTOS queues for command processing and software timers for precise task scheduling. Ideal for embedded systems, it showcases advanced multitasking capabilities and real-time data management through intuitive user interfaces.
